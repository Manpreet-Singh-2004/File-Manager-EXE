## ‚ùì Why EXE Instead of a Setup?

Unlike traditional installers, this version is a **portable `.exe`** for the following reasons:

- ‚úÖ Preserves internal file structure used by the app (critical for SQLite + file handling).
- ‚úÖ Allows direct local file uploads without permission errors.
- ‚úÖ Ideal for users who want a **ready-to-run experience** without going through installation steps.
- ‚úÖ Fixes path-related issues that occur in `AppData` when packaged as a Setup installer.

> TL;DR: This `.exe` gives better performance and stability for how this app handles files.

## Troubleshooting & Known Issues

### 1. ‚ùå `file-manager` or `file-manager-app` dependency error

**Issue:** 
If you get a `Failed to locate module "file-manager"` or something similar...


**Fix:**
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
- Make sure your `package.json` does NOT have `"file-manager": "file:"` under `dependencies`
- Run:
  ```bash
  npm cache clean --force
  npm install
  ```

### 2. üîí Input fields (like username) not working

**Issue:** Sometimes input fields like username/password may appear unresponsive.

**Cause:**  
This happens when `preload.js` becomes inactive (common in some Electron windows on initial load).

**Fix:**
- Simply **minimize** the window and then **reopen** it.  
  This reloads `preload.js` and restores full input field interactivity.

You‚Äôll now be able to type and click as expected.
